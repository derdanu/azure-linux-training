## Create the virtual machine
### Create the  virtual machine on the Azure Portal

<a href="https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fderdanu%2Fazure-linux-training%2Fmaster%2Fazuredeploy.json" target="_blank">

</a>

### Create the virtual machine with powershell

```powershell
New-AzureRmResourceGroupDeployment -Name <DeploymentName> -ResourceGroupName <RessourceGroupName> -TemplateUri https://raw.githubusercontent.com/derdanu/azure-linux-training/master/azuredeploy.json
```

### Create the virtual machine with azure cli
```
azure group deployment create <RessourceGroupName> <DeploymentName> --template-uri https://raw.githubusercontent.com/derdanu/azure-linux-training/master/azuredeploy.json
```

## Docker Image 

### Run the Ubuntu container

```
docker run -it dfalkner/azure-linux-training:ubuntu /bin/bash
```

### Run the Centos container

```
docker run -it dfalkner/azure-linux-training:centos /bin/bash
```

# Scenario validation
This image comes with a utility to train certain scenarios which are common for Linux related certification such as Linux Foundation Certified Systemadministrator (LFCS). The container version of this image has limited support for this validation as the required infrastrcuture is not available. To make full use of the validation use the virtual machine.

## Scenarios
Currently the following explicit scenarios are implemented. Some of the scenarios imply other activities such as installing required software packages or elevate permissions. These scenarios are currently not explicitly mentioned.

ID | Domain | Area | Description 
------------ | ------------ | ------------ |-------------
SA-BR-001 | System Administration | Backup & Recovery | Create a backup '/opt/alt/exams.tar.gz' with the recursive content of '/opt/alt/exams'
